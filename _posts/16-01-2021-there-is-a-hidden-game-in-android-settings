Overview:
• Bored at work? In line at the supermarket? Need to keep the kids entertained? Android has a hidden video game


{: .box-note}
Steps:

1. On your android, Go to Settings > System > About Phone (or Software info),

2. Click on “Android version,” tap on it multiple times and you’ll see a logo for Nougat or Marshmallow.

3. Tap a few times again and now press and hold the circle on the screen. A secret minigame will appear.

4. Give some tries to this small sized too much hard game ;)
